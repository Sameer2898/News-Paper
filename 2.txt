Elon Musk is the co-founder and CEO at Tesla, overseeing all product design, engineering and manufacturing of the company's electric vehicles, battery products, and Solar Roofs.
Since the company’s inception in 2003, Tesla’s mission has been to accelerate the world’s transition to a sustainable energy future. The first Tesla product, the Roadster sports car, debuted in 2008, followed by the Model S sedan, which was introduced in 2012, and the Model X SUV, which launched in 2015. Model S was named Motor Trend 2013 Car of the Year and received Consumer Reports’ Best Overall Car, while Model X was the first SUV ever to earn 5-star safety ratings in every category and sub-category in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s tests. In 2017, Tesla began deliveries of Model 3, a $35,000 mass-market electric car with over 215 miles of range, and unveiled Tesla Semi, which is designed to save owners at least $200,000 over a million miles based on fuel costs alone.
